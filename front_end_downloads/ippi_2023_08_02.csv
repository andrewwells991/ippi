Some of the benefits will include;  6.1 	Road Maintenance costs With the new construction from gravel to bituminous surfaced standard, the road will operate in an all-weather condition. Ultimately, emergency maintenance works during the rainy season and costs will be reduced as concentration will be on routine maintenance activities such as drainage structures cleaning, line marking, grass cutting and patching of any potholes that may occur.  6.2	Vehicle Operating and Passenger Travel costs Vehicle operating costs savings constitute the most important benefit attributable to the project. This will have direct reduction on maintenance cost of the vehicles, reduced fuel consumption and travel time.  	6.3	Agriculture The area where the road passes is an agricultural rich area for mainly tobacco, coffee, maize and bananas. The upgrading of the road will ease problems of transporting farm inputs and produce to and from various markets.  	6.4	Environmental and Health The upgrading of the road will reduce the occurrence of dust and mud along the project area and thereby improving sanitation which means reduction in the spread of diseases which are airborne or waterborne. This will reduce the cost of medicines which would have been required to treat the people affected. The upgrading of the road will allow the communities good access to health facilities in town.  	6.5	Employment Creation and Business Boosting The people around the area of the road project are also benefitting by getting employed in various road activities by the Contractor.

This will have direct reduction on maintenance cost of the vehicles, reduced fuel consumption and travel time. Passengers will now be paying less and spending less time on travel. Availability of buses and minibuses will greatly improve transportation of passengers. 6.4	Agriculture The area where the road passes is an agricultural area for mainly tobacco, maize and groundnuts. The upgrading of the road will ease problems of transporting farm inputs and produce to and from various markets. 6.5	Environmental and Health The upgrading will reduce the occurrence of dust and mud along the project area and thereby improving sanitation that means reduction in the spread of diseases, which are airborne or waterborne. This will reduce the cost of medicines, which would have been required to treat the people affected.

The Road will be upgraded to an all-weather bitumen standard road with a cross section of 6.8m carriageway and 1.5m shoulders with an asphalt concrete surfacing.","The project will have many benefits to the people of Mkanda and Kapiri. Some of the benefits will include;  1.	Reduction of Travel Time The road upgrade will greatly reduce the travel time of road users in the surrounding community.  2.	Maintenance costs With the new construction from gravel to bituminous surfaced standard, the road will operate in an all-weather condition. Ultimately, emergency maintenance works during the rainy season and costs will be reduced as concentration will be on routine maintenance activities such as drainage structures cleaning, line marking, grass cutting and patching of any potholes that may occur.   3.	Vehicle Operating and Passenger Travel costs Vehicle operating costs savings constitute the most important benefit attributable to the project. This will have direct reduction on maintenance cost of the vehicles, reduced fuel consumption and travel time. Passengers will now be paying less and spending less time on travel. Availability of buses and minibuses will greatly improve. 4.	Agriculture The area where the road passes is an agricultural area for mainly tobacco, maize, beans, potatoes and groundnuts. The upgrading of the road will ease problems of transporting farm inputs and produce to and from various markets. . 5.	Employment Creation and Business Boosting The people around the area of the road project will also benefit by getting employed in various road activities by the Contractor. During project implementation and after, a lot of businesses will be enhanced along the project road and the communities will be empowered   6.	Environmental and Health The upgrading will reduce the occurrence of dust and mud along the project area and thereby improving sanitation which means reduction in the spread of diseases which are airborne or waterborne. This will reduce the cost of medicines which would have been required to treat the people affected. The upgrading of the road will allow the communities good access to health facilities in town.","2021-08-01","2022-04-28","MWK","4300016478.58",""

Reduction in Vehicle Operating Costs Upgrading of the road will result in reduction of vehicle operating costs which constitutes the major benefit attributable to such new projects.  		 Reduction in Travel Time and Cost  The project will help reduce travel time from the agricultural areas.  Passengers will now be paying less and spending less time on travel. Availability of buses and minibuses will greatly improve. Agriculture The area where the road passes is an agricultural area for mainly Irish potatoes and maize. The upgrading of the road will ease problems of transporting farm inputs and produce to and from various markets. Environmental and Health The upgrading will reduce the occurrence of dust and mud along the project area and thereby improving sanitation which means reduction in the spread of diseases which are airborne or waterborne. This will reduce the cost of medicines which would have been required to treat the people affected. The upgrading of the road will allow the communities good access to health facilities in town especially for referral cases.","2022-12-08","2024-06-08","MWK","34482770777.05",""
